# MazeWorld
A Java program to create a maze and then systematically solve it

This program uses Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm to cut a maze out of a graph, and then can use either a breath first search or a depth first search to solve the maze. There is also an option for a player to manually find their way through the maze.
